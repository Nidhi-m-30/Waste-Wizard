**Problem Statement**
The global transition to renewable energy faces significant hurdles, including high costs and the prioritization of short-term savings over long-term sustainability. Existing campus energy models often neglect the potential of sustainable sources, leading to the inefficient management of bio-waste, which emits harmful methane in landfills.

**Solution Overview**
Waste Wizard presents a comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges:

**1. Efficient Bio-waste Conversion**
Development of a system to collect and convert 100% of bio-waste into clean energy.

**2. Smart Bin & Mobile App Integration**
Utilization of smart bins linked with a user-friendly mobile app for seamless waste collection.

**3. Incentivized Waste Collection**
Offer incentives and free waste collection services to incentivize customer participation.

**4. Biofuel Generation & Fertilizer Production**
Bio-waste is converted into energy using a biofuel generator, with the byproduct slurry used as fertilizer.

**5. Energy Transport via Electric Shuttles**
Utilization of campus electric shuttles for the transportation of bio-waste-derived energy.

**6. Cost and Energy Estimates**
The approximate setup cost of a Biodigester (1000L) is CAD 1000. Each cubic meter of biowaste contains about 6kWh energy, with 2kWh usable for energy generation.

**Key Features**
**Bio-waste Conversion:** Transforming bio-waste into clean energy efficiently.

**Smart Collection System:** Integration of smart bins and a user-friendly mobile app for waste collection.

**Circular Economy Model:** Generating both energy and fertilizer from bio-waste.

**Implementation Insights**
For successful implementation, considerations include logistical planning for waste collection, infrastructure requirements for biofuel generation, and stakeholder engagement. Evaluating environmental impact and scalability is vital for the long-term viability of this solution.
